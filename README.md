## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Limitation | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Inference speed** | Gemma 4 on CPU: 20–90s per response. Not suitable for <8GB RAM devices |
| **Initial setup** | Requires Node.js, Ollama, and ~3GB model download |
| **No real-time collaboration** | Students work independently; no shared live sessions |
| **Single-machine default** | Designed for local use; classroom multi-student requires local network config |
| **Model accuracy** | Gemma 4 E4B can hallucinate on niche topics; verify answers for high-stakes use |
| **Vision quality** | Handwritten text recognition depends on image clarity |
| **MemoryStore sessions** | Sessions reset on server restart (no Redis persistence) |

---

## 🔭 Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Lighter model support** — Gemma 3 1B/2B for 4GB RAM devices
- [ ] **USB classroom bundle** — pre-packaged installer for offline school deployment
- [ ] **Curriculum alignment** — map topics to CBSE, Common Core, Cambridge IGCSE syllabi
- [ ] **Parent/guardian dashboard** — weekly progress digest generated locally
- [ ] **Collaborative Socratic sessions** — two students, one AI tutor
- [ ] **Adaptive difficulty auto-detection** — infer level from first response
- [ ] **PDF study guide export** — export session explanations as a formatted study sheet
- [ ] **Redis session store** — persistent sessions across server restarts

## ✨ Features

### 🎓 Learning Modes
| Mode | How it works |
|------|-------------|
| **Tutor Mode** (default) | Structured explanations with steps, follow-up questions, instant quizzes |
| **Socratic Mode** | AI guides you to *discover* the answer through exactly 5 witty questions — never just tells you. Turn 5 delivers a 🎯 Big Picture summary. |
| **Agent Mode** | Full pipeline: explain + quiz + track + suggest next topic in one request |

### 🎭 Witty Socratic Tutor
The Socratic tutor is a high-energy, pop-culture-savvy AI that guides discovery through **exactly 5 questions**. Each question builds on your previous answer, nudging you closer to the concept without ever giving it away. On Turn 5, you get a 🎯 **Big Picture** summary tying all your answers together.

### 📈 Dynamic Progress Evaluation Report
Click the **📈 Evaluation Report** button to get a personalised 5-section learning analysis:
- **Learning Trajectory** — how your focus is shifting over time
- **Cross-Pollination** — hidden connections between your studied topics
- **Vocabulary Heatmap** — how your language is evolving
- **Big Domino** — the ONE keystone topic that would unlock the most progress
- **Micro-Mission** — a specific 2-minute task to do right now

### 🗺 Concept Maps
Generate an interactive knowledge graph for any topic. Gemma 4 produces a nodes-and-edges map showing how concepts connect, rendered as an animated force-directed graph using D3.js.

### 📊 Spaced Repetition (SM-2)
Every quiz score feeds the SM-2 algorithm. Topics are scheduled for review at scientifically optimal intervals (Day 1 → 6 → exponential). A **"Due for Review"** banner appears automatically on your study days.

### 🔥 Learning Streaks
Tracks consecutive study days. Streak badge appears in the header — turns orange at 3+ days.

### 🧠 Smart 4-Layer Cache
1. Live taxonomy resolution
2. Normalised hash lookup (catches varied phrasing)
3. In-flight deduplication
4. Disk persistence (48-hour TTL)

~70% bandwidth reduction via gzip. Predictive pre-warming caches your next suggested topic in the background.

### 📚 Dynamic Topic Taxonomy
76 topics with 1,223 keywords across 9 subjects. Topics asked 2+ times are auto-promoted to the learned taxonomy. Admin panel at `/taxonomy-admin` for manual curation + bulk CSV/Excel upload.

### 📸 Homework Photo Analysis
Upload a photo of any homework problem — Gemma 4's vision capability explains it step-by-step. Robust error handling with defensive retry logic, async file cleanup, and multer error boundaries. Collapsible sections for easy scanning.

### 🎙 Voice Input
Click the microphone icon and speak your question. Features auto-restart on unexpected session end, no-speech error recovery, 2500ms silence timeout, and a live voice preview status bar with ✓ (send) and ✕ (cancel) buttons.

### 🔍 Developer Diagnostics Panel
Built-in **Metrics** and **Flow** tabs (press the 🛠 button):
- **Metrics**: Request counts, latency percentiles, cache hit rates per route
- **Flow**: Real-time flow traces showing every internal step (taxonomy lookup → cache check → Ollama call → JSON parse) with millisecond-level timing and bottleneck detection

### 🌐 Native Multilingual Engine (Zero-Lag)
Learn in any of 140+ languages. Select your language from the 🌐 header dropdown — the system prompt is dynamically rewritten so Gemma 4 responds entirely in your chosen language. No translation API, no extra model, no additional latency. Starter set: English, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin, French, Portuguese, Bengali, Tamil, Swahili.

### 📝 Advanced Formatting Engine
- Strips `<think>…</think>` reasoning blocks emitted by Gemma models before parsing
- Robust JSON extraction: direct parse → code-fence strip → brace extraction → trailing-comma repair
- Rich fallback renderer converts markdown-like text to formatted HTML (headers, bold, italic, code blocks, inline code, lists) when structured JSON isn't available

### 🎨 Three Adaptive Themes
- **Beginner** (ages 8–12): playful, colourful, emoji-rich
- **Intermediate** (high school): clean, professional
- **Advanced** (university): terminal-style, monospace

### 📱 Progressive Web App
Install on any device directly from the browser. Works fully offline — the shell is cached by the service worker, Ollama runs locally.

### 🐍 Low-Latency Python Bridge (`python/`)
A standalone Python module (`StudyBuddyCore`) that talks directly to the local Ollama instance for sub-5-second response times on an 8 GB MacBook Air. Key design choices:

- **Streaming-first** — tokens print to stdout the instant they arrive via `httpx` streaming
- **orjson decoding** — minimal CPU overhead when parsing Ollama's newline-delimited JSON chunks
- **Hard-capped generation** — `num_predict: 100`, `temperature: 0.1` for deterministic, tight answers
- **Model pinned in RAM** — `keep_alive: -1` prevents re-loading between queries
- **Sprint/Think routing** — a strict system prompt forces the model to classify queries as `[SPRINT]` (direct answer) or `[THINK]` (3-step Socratic hint, max 50 words), returning compact `{"m": "S"|"T", "a": "..."}` JSON

## 🛡 Reliability & Performance

| Area | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Quiz answer matching** | Frontend uses index-based option selection (not string literals in HTML onclick), immune to HTML entity encoding, quote escaping, and LLM re-serialisation artefacts |
| **Quiz timeout resilience** | AbortController with 110 s hard timeout; graceful 200 fallback instead of 500 error |
| **Cache observability** | `[cache L4 MISS]` / `[cache WRITE]` debug logging for diagnosing cache behaviour |
| **Benchmark suite** | `node benchmark.js` — 28 endpoints with per-route time targets; 150 s timeout; robust validators |
